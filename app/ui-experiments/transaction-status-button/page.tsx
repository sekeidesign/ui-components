			<Experiment.Description>
				Based on{" "}
				<TextLink href="https://family.co/" target="_blank" hasFavicon>
					Family
				</TextLink>{" "}
				by{" "}
				<TextLink
					href="https://benji.org/family-values"
					target="_blank"
					hasFavicon
				>
					Benji Taylor
				</TextLink>
				<span className="py-1 block" />
				In my first attempt the text had a &quot;jelly&quot; effect,
				particularly when animating between the &quot;Analyzing&quot; and
				&quot;Success&quot; states. <br />
				Thankfully I had recently read about{" "}
				<TextLink
					href="https://www.nan.fyi/magic-motion"
					target="_blank"
					hasFavicon
				>
					how Motion&apos;s &quot;magic&quot; layout property works
				</TextLink>
				, which made it clear that this was caused by the text trying to
				transform from one string to the next. <br />
				The fix was simply to add a unique key to the text for each state, which
				ensures only the button magically transforms between states, while the
				label simply translates on the x axis and fades in and out.
